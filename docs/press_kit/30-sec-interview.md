> Why this book now?

Because a lot of people feel politically engaged but increasingly powerless. We vote, debate, and follow the news, yet decisions don’t seem to lead to lasting change. This book argues that the problem isn’t apathy or ideology—it’s that our systems aren’t designed to learn or correct themselves fast enough. Freedom quietly erodes when mistakes become irreversible. What I’m offering isn’t a new political program, but a way to design institutions so they can adapt, stay credible, and keep the future open before crisis forces the issue.
