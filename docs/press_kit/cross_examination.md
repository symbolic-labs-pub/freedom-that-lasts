## **Left–Right Cross-Examination**

**Left Interviewer:**
Your system sounds neutral, which usually means it protects existing power and inequality.

**Right Interviewer:**
And to me it sounds like bureaucratic overengineering that kills individual freedom.

**Respondent:**
If a system protects existing power *and* restricts individual freedom, it’s already failed. What I’m proposing makes power temporary and freedom durable by keeping decisions reversible.

**Left:**
Where is justice in your framework? You barely talk about redistribution or historical harm.

**Right:**
And where is personal responsibility? Sounds like more systems instead of accountability.

**Respondent:**
Justice and responsibility both fail when mistakes become permanent. This system makes correction routine, so responsibility actually matters and injustice doesn’t get locked in.

**Left:**
Urgent crises—climate, inequality—require fast action, not slow learning cycles.

**Right:**
Fast action is exactly how governments overreach and never give power back.

**Respondent:**
Fast *reversible* action is good. Fast *irreversible* action is dangerous. The system distinguishes between the two—that’s the entire point.

**Left:**
Delegation to experts always sidelines marginalized voices.

**Right:**
Experts shouldn’t be deciding anything in the first place.

**Respondent:**
Experts don’t decide permanently here. Their authority expires unless people keep choosing them. That gives ordinary people more leverage, not less.

**Left:**
You avoid naming capitalism, which is the real source of the problem.

**Right:**
And you avoid shrinking government, which is the real solution.

**Respondent:**
Any system—capitalist or not, big or small—can destroy its future if it can’t correct itself. I’m addressing the mechanism that causes that failure, not defending a doctrine.

---

**Left:**
Neutral systems always favor those with more time, money, and influence.

**Right:**
And complex systems always favor insiders who know how to game them.

**Respondent:**
That’s why this system limits accumulation. Power decays unless renewed, and decisions are scoped. Insiders lose advantage when authority can’t settle.

---

**Left:**
You’re underestimating how entrenched power fights back.

**Right:**
You’re underestimating how much people hate being managed.

**Respondent:**
I’m assuming both. That’s why this system doesn’t require trust, virtue, or obedience—only the ability to withdraw authority and correct course.

---

**Left:**
This feels abstract compared to real suffering.

**Right:**
This feels academic compared to real life.

**Respondent:**
What’s abstract is pretending systems will fix themselves later. What’s real is whether people can escape bad decisions without collapse.

---

**Left:**
Who actually benefits from this system?

**Right:**
Who pays the price when it fails?

**Respondent:**
The people with the least margin for error benefit most. And when it fails, it fails locally and early—before anyone’s future is destroyed.

---

**Left:**
So you’re saying this solves politics?

**Right:**
Or that politics shouldn’t matter anymore?

**Respondent:**
Neither. Politics still matters—but it stops being a fight over permanent control of the future.

---

**Left:**
Final question—why should progressives trust this?

**Right:**
And why should conservatives?

**Respondent:**
Because it doesn’t ask either side to win forever. It only asks that no side be able to lose forever by accident.
