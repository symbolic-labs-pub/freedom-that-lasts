## **Academic Synopsis**

**Freedom That Lasts** advances a systems-theoretic redefinition of freedom appropriate to contemporary mass societies characterized by high complexity, deep interdependence, and irreversible decision dynamics. Departing from dominant negative and positive liberty frameworks, the book conceptualizes freedom as the preservation of future option space—the sustained capacity of individuals and polities to revise decisions without systemic breakdown.

The work begins by diagnosing a structural paradox common to modern democracies: intensifying participation coexisting with declining perceived agency and institutional trust. Rather than attributing this condition to civic deficit, elite capture, or ideological polarization, the book locates its origin in the temporal properties of governance systems—specifically, the accumulation of irreversible commitments, delayed feedback, and misaligned incentive structures. Freedom erosion is shown to occur incrementally through rational, locally justified decisions whose long-term consequences remain structurally under-examined.

Integrating insights from political theory, game theory, complex systems engineering, economics, and biological regulation, the book reframes freedom as a stability property rather than a moral abstraction. It demonstrates how repeated decision environments naturally drift toward equilibria that are locally Pareto-improving yet globally destabilizing, and why Nash-stable outcomes under short-term rationality frequently undermine long-term collective autonomy. Biological homeostasis is employed not metaphorically but structurally, offering a comparative model for maintaining system viability under uncertainty and bounded rationality.

The central contribution of the book is a coherent institutional framework designed to operationalize freedom preservation. This framework introduces revocable and domain-scoped decision rights in place of universalized voting, legally mandated feedback cycles and sunset mechanisms for legislation, adaptive budgeting constrained by execution capacity and reversibility, and capability-based execution architectures that privilege empirical performance over formal optimization. These mechanisms are unified by a small set of design invariants: proportional reversibility, mandatory feedback, symmetry between authority and consequence, constraint-first reasoning, and low-cost institutional learning.

Importantly, the book anticipates and systematically addresses normative and empirical objections. It demonstrates why the proposed architecture does not imply technocracy, authoritarian consolidation, or epistemic elitism, and why it remains robust under conditions of persistent disagreement and low social trust. Authority within the system is explicitly non-accumulative, temporally bounded, and continuously contestable, rendering power capture dynamically unstable.

The final sections extend the analysis to phenomenological and cultural dimensions, examining how such institutional arrangements reshape political affect, reduce polarization pressure, and normalize correction as a non-pathological governance activity. Freedom is ultimately framed not as a terminal state or normative guarantee, but as a continuous practice of institutional maintenance.

Written at the intersection of political philosophy, institutional economics, and systems theory, **Freedom That Lasts** contributes a novel analytical framework to debates on democratic resilience, institutional design, and intergenerational justice. It will be of interest to scholars in political theory, public policy, economics, governance studies, and complex systems, as well as advanced graduate courses concerned with the long-term stability of democratic institutions.
