Freedom That Lasts - Event-sourced governance kernel

Preserves future option space through revocable delegation, time-bound laws,
and anti-tyranny safeguards. Implements concepts from the book "Freedom That Lasts"
as deterministic, auditable code.

Fun fact: The average lifespan of a democracy is around 200 years - this system
aims to extend that by making freedom structurally stable, not just aspirational.
