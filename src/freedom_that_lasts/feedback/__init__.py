Feedback Module - Anti-Tyranny Monitoring & Reflexes

This module provides the automated safeguards and health monitoring:
- Risk indicators (concentration metrics, Gini coefficient)
- Trigger evaluation (automatic warnings and halts)
- FreedomHealth scorecard (overall system health)

Fun fact: These are the "immune system" of the governance system,
automatically detecting and responding to threats to freedom!
